# To-Do List App

This project is a task management app, allowing users to:
- Add new tasks.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Filter and sort tasks.
- Mark tasks as "Done" or "To Do" by clicking on them

Tasks are stored locally using the browser's **Local Storage**, meaning they will persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
